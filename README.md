## Deploying to Netlify

> This is a personal recommendation based on my own experience. For more information on this, please visit [Gatsby's official documentation about deploying on Netlify](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-to-netlify/).

For the `Build` command, instead of the default and simple `gatsby build` I recommend to use `gatsby clean && gatsby build`.
